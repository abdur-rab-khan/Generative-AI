    "### Why Messages use?.\n",
    "Most of the mordern LLM'S provides a chat model interface that accept a list of messages as an input. Langchain's ChatModel accept list of messages object as an input. These Messages are come with variety of forms such as (`HumanMessage`, `AIMessage`, `ToolMessage`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Messages in our Graph.\n",
    "* It is helpful to store the prior conversation history as a list of messages in our graph state.\n",
    "* To do this, we can add a key (channel) to the graph state that stores a list of `Message` objects and annotated with their reducer function.\n",
    "* By using `operator.add` as a reducer they simply append the messages to the existing list `But sometime you does not want like that.`\n",
    "    * We might also want to update manually in our graph state (eg. `human-in-the-loop`). In this case if you we `operator.add` the manual state updates you send to the graph would be appended to the existing list of messages, instead of updating exisiting messages\n",
    "    * TO avoid this we use pre-build function called `add_messages` function. For brand new messages it will simply append to existing list, but it will also handle the update for existing messages correctly."

    "* It is a process to change objects (like prompts, chains, tools, memory, etc.) into a format that can be saved, transmitted, and later reconstructed.\n",
    "* In addition to keep track of messages IDs. the `add_messages` function will also try to deseriallize message into Langchain `Message` objects. whenever a `State` update is received on the `messages` channel.\n",
