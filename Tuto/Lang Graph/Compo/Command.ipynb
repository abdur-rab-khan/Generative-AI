This enables features like human-in-the-loop interactions, memory management, and fault-tolerance. You can even directly manipulate a graph's state after its execution using the appropriate get and update methods. For more details, see the persistence conceptual guide.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph provides built-in document storage through the BaseStore interface. Unlike checkpointers, which save state by thread ID, stores use custom namespaces for organizing data. This enables cross-thread persistence, allowing agents to maintain long-term memories, learn from past interactions, and accumulate knowledge over time. Common use cases include storing user profiles, building knowledge bases, and managing global preferences across all threads."
